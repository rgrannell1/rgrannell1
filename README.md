### Hi, I'm [R√≥is√≠n](https://www.nameshouts.com/names/all-languages/pronounce-roisin) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

(she/her, they/them)

I write a lot of code. Professionally I'm a site-reliability engineer, in my free time I write CLI tools, websites, frameworks, and occasionally data-analysis projects.

First, some of my favourite animals:
